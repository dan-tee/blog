The best way to learn an algorithm is to watch it in action. That is why I created the simplest
non linear neural network in [Keras](http://keras.io) and trained it on the simplest non linear
example. I learned way more on this that I expected. That is why I created some awesome
visualizations of how this simple network learns.

The data that we are going to predict is generated by a bilinear function that is `0` in the
interval `[0, 1]` and has the value `x-1` on the interval `[1, 2]`.
