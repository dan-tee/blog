Summary: My very personal reason to start this blog is ...

There are many reasons to start a blog. My idol Jeff Atwood lists very good ones in
[how to achieve ultimate blog success in one easy step](http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step/):

> Every time I wrote, I got a little better at writing.
> Every time I wrote, I learned a little more about the topic, how to research topics effectively,
> where the best sources of information were. Every time I wrote,
> I was slightly more plugged in to the rich software development community all around me.

My very personal reason to start this blog is document my side projects. I spent a lot of time on
them lately. But it's my free time, so I just do the fun part. I make it work 80% in 20% of the
time and hardly document anything.

This way I miss out on the great new possibilities of the Internet age. I can so easily get my
work in front of other people, learn from their feedback and maybe help someone on the way to get
started.

And this is how it works according to Jeff:

> Pick a schedule you can live with, and **stick to it**. Until you do that, none of the other advice
> I could give you will matter.

So I hereby declare to the never forgetting Internet, that I will blog from now on for no less than 2 times a month.
