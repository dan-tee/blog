The first blog that really caught me was [Coding Horror](http://http://blog.codinghorror.com) by Jeff Atwood. He is
also one of the cofounders of [Stack Overflow](http://http://stackoverflow.com/) and
[Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/). I was super late on the train when I discovered it in 2012. At the time I
worked as a programmer at an enterprise software company and was constantly frustrated with the shitty code I was
maintaining and writing myself. So Jeff hit a nerve when wrote in
[the great enterprise software swindle](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-great-enterprise-software-swindle/):

> It's madness. As far as I'm concerned, the word "Enterprise" is now so tainted that it's best used as an epithet.
> Dude, your software sucks so much, it's enterprise software.

There are many reasons to start a blog. My idol Jeff Atwood aka Coding Horror lists very good ones in
[how to achieve ultimate blog success in one easy step](http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-achieve-ultimate-blog-success-in-one-easy-step/):

> Every time I wrote, I got a little better at writing.
> Every time I wrote, I learned a little more about the topic, how to research topics effectively,
> where the best sources of information were. Every time I wrote,
> I was slightly more plugged in to the rich software development community all around me.


Lately I spent a lot of time on side projects. It's my free time, so I just do the fun part. I make it work 80% in 20%
of the time and hardly document anything. I [sharpen my saw](http://blog.codinghorror.com/sharpening-the-saw/) and
often reach a state of [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) which already makes it worthwile.

But I know I can get more out of this. For myself and for others. That is why I now start this blog. To start a
discussion. I'd love to know what you would do differently. Or to help you kickstart your own learning or toy project.

And this is how it works according to Jeff:

> Pick a schedule you can live with, and **stick to it**. Until you do that, none of the other advice
> I could give you will matter.

Expect me to churn out at least 2 posts a month. And please take me up on it.
