The web is full of good explanations of machine learning algorithms. And every second applicant for a
data science position has finished the
[Coursera course on machine learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
While it is important to understand the concepts behind the algorithms,
one thing is even more important:

>You need to learn how to **apply** machine learning algorithms

There is a big difference betweeen the theory and the application of machine learning algorithms.
If you look at the people winning [kaggle competitions](http://kaggle.com)[^2], it's rarely highly
decorated machine learning researchers. It's people who spent a lot of time applying machine learning
algorithms. Check yourself. Kaggle publishes
[profiles of top kagglers](http://blog.kaggle.com/tag/profiling-top-kagglers/) on their blog.

[^2]: [Kaggle](http://kaggle.com) is the largest site hosting machine learning competitions. Companies
publish their data and everybody can compete to make the best prediction from this data. The winners
can earn up to hundreds of thousands of dollars.

Contrary to what beginners might think, few data scientists spend their day optimzing machine
learning algorithms. That's what they do at night, because that's what they consider fun. They
spend their days gathering, cleaning and transforming their data. They talk to engineers to understand
how the data is created and to the management to understand the business needs. And once all that is
done, few time is left in which they actually use a library and **apply** machine learning algorithms.

Of course I'm simplifying here. data science is a vast field. In online advertisement, some teams
get their data served by awesome data engineers and
can squeeze the last digits out of their favorite algorithms. Others in young startups
focus on understanding their users on a high level. They might not even need any
machine learning. I'm going to write another post about the fragmentation of data science soon.

The very core of data science is understanding data and making predictions. If you wanna get better at
this, there is no better way than to actually get your hands dirty and work with complex real world data.
That is why my number one recommendation to become an expert in data science is:

> Learn by competing in data science competitions.

It is easy to get this one wrong, though. The price money and the leaderboard could easily
make you think it is about winning data science competitions. The inglorious truth is, winning is a distraction.
Winning a data science competition needs skills that you might not need in a data science job.
You need to build overly complex models, fit them to the leaderboard and squeeze out the last fractions of a
percentage point. Even the winning model of the Netflix prize
[hasn't been used in practice](http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/04/netflix-recommendations-beyond-5-stars.html).

What makes Kaggle such a great resource for learning is the access to various complex data sets.
You can use them to build models and compare their predictive power to the leaderboard. You have
a quick perspective on what's possible. You have the Forum, where you can learn from other
people. You can compete in a team and learn how to collaborate on a predictive model.

Personally, I try to build simple models that still come close to the leaderboard. Not necesarrily in rank,
but in the prediction error. I usually join competitions where the features have description. It's just
closer to real data. My favorite so far was the
[Rossman Store Sales competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales). I usually spend more time
on feature engineering than on the machine learning models.

My chances of winning price money are as small as in a lottery. Still the money somehow motivates me.
[Prosepect theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory) gives a
possible explanation. It's great that I can trick me into doing something so useful.

While machine learning skills are core to beeing an expert in data science, it's also easy to overestimate their
importance. John Foreman wrote a great [blog post](http://analyticsmadeskeezy.com/2012/11/05/check-yo-self-5-things-you-should-know-about-data-science-author-note/)
to put them into perspective.

> Data scientist is a poor term. Communication and creativity are most important.

The classic [Venn Diagram of Data Science](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram)
makes a similar point. I think of communication skills as part of substantive expertise here. It's clearly
not what hackers and mathematicians are known for.
