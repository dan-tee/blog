The web is full of good explanations of machine learning algorithms. Every second
applicant for a Data Science position seems to have finished the Coursera couse on
machine learning. But if you want to solve real world problems, knowing the theory
doesn't get you very far. Few data scientists spend their day optimzing machine
learning algorithms. That's what they do at night, because that's what they
consider fun.

If you look at the people winning [kaggle competitions](http://kaggle.com), it's
not highly decorated machine learning researchers. It's people who spent a lot of
time applying machine learning algorithms. (insert footnote about what is good
about kaggle and what not) That's why I recommend anyone who wants to study
machine learning to get their hands dirty as early and often as possible.
